# `<ClientApp>` Component

The `<ClientApp>` component is the entry component for the client-side, which accepts a `router` property for rendering the entire application. During SSR (Server-Side Rendering), `hydrate` needs to be set to `true`. For usage, please refer to [Creating a Project](creating-a-project) and [Server-Side Rendering](ssr).
